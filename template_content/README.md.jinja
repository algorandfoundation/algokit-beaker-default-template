# {{ project_name }}

This project has been generated using AlgoKit. See below for default getting started instructions.

# Setup

### Pre-requisites

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (we recommended 3.12+)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for LocalNet only)

> For interactive tour over the codebase, download [vsls-contrib.codetour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) extension for VS Code, then open the [`.codetour.json`](./.tours/getting-started-with-your-algokit-project.tour) file in code tour extension.

### Initial Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

#### 2. Install Pre-requisites
Ensure the following pre-requisites are installed and properly configured:

- **Docker**: Required for running a local Algorand network. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- **AlgoKit CLI**: Essential for project setup and operations. Install the latest version from [AlgoKit CLI Installation Guide](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli#install). Verify installation with `algokit --version`, expecting `2.0.0` or later.

#### 3. Bootstrap Your Local Environment
Run the following commands within the project folder:

- **Install Poetry**: Required for Python dependency management. [Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Verify with `poetry -V` to see version `1.2`+.
- **Setup Project**: Execute `algokit bootstrap all` to:
  - Install dependencies and setup a Python virtual environment in `.venv`.
  - Copy `.env.template` to `.env`.
- **Start LocalNet**: Use `algokit localnet start` to initiate a local Algorand network.
- **Install Project Dependencies**: With `algokit project bootstrap all`, ensure all dependencies are ready.

### Development Workflow

#### Terminal
Directly manage and interact with your project using AlgoKit commands:

1. **Build Contracts**: `algokit project run build` compiles all smart contracts.
2. **Deploy**: Use `algokit project deploy localnet` to deploy contracts to the local network.

#### VS Code 
For a seamless experience with breakpoint debugging and other features:

1. **Open Project**: In VS Code, open the repository root.
2. **Install Extensions**: Follow prompts to install recommended extensions.
3. **Debugging**:
   - Use `F5` to start debugging.
   - **Windows Users**: Select the Python interpreter at `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe` via `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` > `Python: Select Interpreter` before the first run.

#### JetBrains IDEs
While primarily optimized for VS Code, JetBrains IDEs are supported:

1. **Open Project**: In your JetBrains IDE, open the repository root.
2. **Automatic Setup**: The IDE should configure the Python interpreter and virtual environment.
3. **Debugging**: Use `Shift+F10` or `Ctrl+R` to start debugging. Note: Windows users may encounter issues with pre-launch tasks due to a known bug. See [JetBrains forums](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-277486/Shell-script-configuration-cannot-run-as-before-launch-task) for workarounds.

## AlgoKit Workspaces and Project Management
This project supports both standalone and monorepo setups through AlgoKit workspaces. Leverage [`algokit project run`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/project/run.md) commands for efficient monorepo project orchestration and management across multiple projects within a workspace.

> For guidance on `smart_contracts` folder and adding new contracts to the project please see [README](smart_contracts/README.md) on the respective folder.

{%- if use_github_actions -%}
### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) to define CI/CD workflows, which are located in the [.github/workflows](`{% if use_workspace %}../../.github/workflows{% else %}.github/workflows{% endif %}`) folder.

> Please note, if you instantiated the project with --workspace flag in `algokit init` it will automatically attempt to move the contents of the `.github` folder to the root of the workspace.

### AlgoKit Workspaces

To define custom `algokit project run` commands refer to [documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/project/run.md). This allows orchestration of commands spanning across multiple projects within an algokit workspace based project (monorepo).

### Debugging Smart Contracts

This project is optimized to work with AlgoKit AVM Debugger extension. To activate it:
{%- if deployment_language == 'python' %}
Refer to the commented header in the `__main__.py` file in the `smart_contracts` folder.
{%- elif deployment_language == 'typescript' %}
Refer to the commented header in the `index.ts` file in the `smart_contracts` folder.
{%- endif %}

If you have opted in to include VSCode launch configurations in your project, you can also use the `Debug TEAL via AlgoKit AVM Debugger` launch configuration to interactively select an available trace file and launch the debug session for your smart contract.

For information on using and setting up the `AlgoKit AVM Debugger` VSCode extension refer [here](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-avm-vscode-debugger). To install the extension from the VSCode Marketplace, use the following link: [AlgoKit AVM Debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=algorandfoundation.algokit-avm-vscode-debugger).

#### Setting up GitHub for CI/CD workflow and TestNet deployment

  1. Every time you have a change to your smart contract, and when you first initialize the project you need to [build the contract](#initial-setup) and then commit the `smart_contracts/artifacts` folder so the [output stability](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/articles/output_stability.md) tests pass
{%- if deployment_language == 'python' %}
  2. Decide what values you want to use for the `allow_update`, `allow_delete` and the `on_schema_break`, `on_update` parameters specified in [`contract.py`](./smart_contracts/{{ contract_name }}/contract.py).
     When deploying to LocalNet these values are both set to allow update and replacement of the app for convenience. But for non-LocalNet networks
     the defaults are more conservative.
{%- elif deployment_language == 'typescript' %}
  2. Decide what values you want to use for the `allowUpdate` and `allowDelete` parameters specified in [`deploy-config.ts`](./smart_contracts/{{ contract_name }}/deploy-config.ts).
     When deploying to LocalNet these values are both set to `true` for convenience. But for non-LocalNet networks
     they are more conservative and use `false`
{%- endif %}
     These default values will allow the smart contract to be deployed initially, but will not allow the app to be updated or deleted if is changed and the build will instead fail.
     To help you decide it may be helpful to read the [AlgoKit Utils app deployment documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/capabilities/app-deploy.md) or the [AlgoKit smart contract deployment architecture](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/architecture-decisions/2023-01-12_smart-contract-deployment.md#upgradeable-and-deletable-contracts).
  3. Create a [Github Environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) named `Test`.
     Note: If you have a private repository and don't have GitHub Enterprise then Environments won't work and you'll need to convert the GitHub Action to use a different approach. Ignore this step if you picked `Starter` preset.
  4. Create or obtain a mnemonic for an Algorand account for use on TestNet to deploy apps, referred to as the `DEPLOYER` account.
  5. Store the mnemonic as a [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#environment-secrets) `DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC`
     in the Test environment created in step 3.
  6. The account used to deploy the smart contract will require enough funds to create the app, and also fund it. There are two approaches available here:
     * Either, ensure the account is funded outside of CI/CD.
       In Testnet, funds can be obtained by using the [Algorand TestNet dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/) and we recommend provisioning 50 ALGOs.
     * Or, fund the account as part of the CI/CD process by using a `DISPENSER_MNEMONIC` GitHub Environment secret to point to a separate `DISPENSER` account that you maintain ALGOs in (similarly, you need to provision ALGOs into this account using the [TestNet dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/)).

#### Continuous Deployment

For pushes to `main` branch, after the above checks pass, the following deployment actions are performed:
  - The smart contract(s) are deployed to TestNet using [AlgoNode](https://algonode.io).

> Please note deployment is also performed via `algokit deploy` command which can be invoked both via CI as seen on this project, or locally. For more information on how to use `algokit deploy` please see [AlgoKit documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/deploy.md).
